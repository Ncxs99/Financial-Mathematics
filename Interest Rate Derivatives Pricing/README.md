### Interest Rate Derivatives

This section is dedicated to the pricing and analysis of interest rate derivatives. We focus on a variety of fixed-income products, with an initial emphasis on bond pricing. 

#### Current Focus:
- **Bond Pricing:**
  - We have implemented methods to calculate the price of bonds, incorporating key metrics such as duration and convexity. These metrics help in assessing the sensitivity of bond prices to changes in interest rates and understanding their risk profiles.
- **Term Structure of Interest Rates**

#### Future Developments:
- This section will continue to evolve with the addition of more sophisticated interest rate derivatives and pricing models. Upcoming features will expand the range of products and analytical tools available.

This area is designed to support financial analysts, portfolio managers, and researchers who are working with interest rate derivatives and fixed-income securities.
