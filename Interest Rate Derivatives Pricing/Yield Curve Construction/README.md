# Yield Curve Construction

### Overview
In the **Yield Curve Construction** section, we delve into building a comprehensive yield curve term structure, essential for modeling interest rates over time. This section provides methods for constructing a *yield term structure* using various interest rate models and numerical techniques. Our approach is designed to be adaptable and will be expanded with additional methods over time.

### Current Features
1. **Term Structure Calculation**: Methods for constructing yield curves based on discount factors and yields.
2. **Interest Rate Models**: The section includes an initial framework for applying interest rate models to derive yield curves. Models allow for flexibility and precision in forecasting and analyzing yield changes across different maturities.
3. **Forward Rate Calculations**: Tools for determining forward rates, leveraging discount factor and yield calculations.

### Future Updates
We aim to enrich this section by integrating additional interest rate models, advanced interpolation techniques, and calibration methods to better support a wide array of financial applications. These updates will make this section a versatile resource for both static and dynamic yield curve modeling needs.
