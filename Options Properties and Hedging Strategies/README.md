### Options Properties and Strategies

Welcome to the **Options Properties and Strategies** section of this repository! In this part of the project, we aim to provide a thorough understanding of different types of financial options and the strategies that traders use when working with them. This section is divided into two main topics: **Options Properties** and **Options Trading Strategies**.

#### Options Properties

We will begin by exploring the key **properties of different types of options**, including:

- **European Options**: Unlike American options, European options can only be exercised at expiration. We will explain how this restriction affects their pricing and their role in various trading strategies.
- **American Options**: These options can be exercised at any time before or at expiration. We will discuss how this flexibility impacts their value, especially compared to European options.
- **Asian Options**: These options are based on the average price of the underlying asset over a specific period rather than the spot price at expiry. We will explore how they differ in pricing and application.
- **Barrier Options**: These are options that become active or inactive depending on whether the underlying asset's price reaches a certain level (the barrier). We will dive into how barrier options work and the various types such as knock-in and knock-out options.
- **Exotic Options**: This category includes options with more complex features, and we will gradually introduce different types of exotic options, detailing their unique characteristics and pricing models.

Each type of option has its own set of properties that determine how it behaves in different market conditions. We will analyze these properties in detail, helping you understand how each option works and how traders use them.

#### Options Trading and Hedging Strategies

In addition to discussing the properties of options, this section will also cover a variety of **classic options trading and hedging strategies**. These strategies are widely used by traders, particularly with **European options**, to manage risk, generate profits, and implement specific market views. Some of the strategies we will cover include:

- **Covered Calls**: A strategy where you hold a long position in an asset and sell a call option on the same asset to generate income.
- **Protective Puts**: A strategy where you buy a put option to protect against potential losses on an underlying asset.
- **Spreads**: Involving the simultaneous buying and selling of options with different strike prices or expiration dates, spreads are a popular way to limit risk while still allowing for profit.
- **Straddles and Strangles**: These strategies involve buying both a call and a put option on the same asset, with the goal of profiting from large price movements, regardless of direction.

We will provide clear examples, explanations, and scenarios for each strategy, helping you understand when and how to use them in different market conditions.

#### Continuous Expansion

This section is continuously evolving. As we progress, we will keep adding new content, expanding on other types of options, and introducing more advanced trading strategies. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in learning about options and how they can be effectively traded in financial markets.
