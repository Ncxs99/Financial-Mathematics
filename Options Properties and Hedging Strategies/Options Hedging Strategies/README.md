### GitHub Repository Description: **Option Hedging Strategies**

This repository focuses on **Option Hedging Strategies**, a critical component of risk management in options trading. Our goal is to provide an intuitive and well-documented implementation of various hedging techniques, making it easier for traders and analysts to understand and apply them.

### Current Implementation:
We currently support **Covered Strategies**, which involve combining options with underlying assets to reduce risk and manage potential losses:
- **Covered Call**: Selling call options while owning the underlying asset.
- **Covered Put**: Selling put options while holding a short position in the underlying asset.

For each strategy, we calculate and display their **Greeks**â€”key metrics used to measure sensitivity to various market factors:
- **Delta**: Sensitivity to price changes in the underlying asset.
- **Gamma**: Rate of change of Delta with respect to the underlying price.
- **Theta**: Sensitivity to the passage of time (time decay).
- **Vega**: Sensitivity to volatility changes in the underlying asset.
- **Rho**: Sensitivity to interest rate changes.

### Future Updates:
We plan to expand the repository with the following strategies:
1. **Protective Strategies**
2. **Spread Strategies**
3. **Straddles and Strangles**
4. **Collars**

Each of these strategies will also include a detailed calculation and visualization of their **Greeks** to provide a comprehensive understanding of their risk profiles.
